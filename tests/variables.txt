Please run model with the following range of variables, in the order
implied by the nested loops, i.e.

run1: layer=0, density =400, reff=200, zen=30, bc=500, dz=[0.02,0.04,0.06,0.08,0.1]

density and reff set uniform over dz (i.e. density = 400 here really means density = [400, 400, 400, 400, 400])
bc confined to upper layer in all cases.


for "layer_type" in [0,1]:
    for "density" in [400, 500, 600, 700, 800]:
        for 'reff' in [200, 400, 600, 80, 1000]:
            for "zen" in [30, 40, 50, 60, 70]:
                for bc in [500, 1000, 1500, 2000]:
                    for "dz" in [[0.02,0.04,0.06, 0.08, 0.1],
                                [0.04,0.06,0.08, 0.10, 0.15],
                                [0.05,0.10,0.15, 0.2, 0.5],
                                [0.15, 0.2, 0.25, 0.3, 0.5],
                                [0.5,0.5,0.5,1,10]]:

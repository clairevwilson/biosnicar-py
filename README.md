# BioSNICAR_GO_PY

Translation of the BioSNICAR_GO model into Python (including translation of the original SNICAR model)


Currently I have only started working on the original SNICAR code (snicar8dmie.py). The matlab code is provided below the python translation (see annotations).

Repository is in active development - very much a work in progress - and collaboration is very welcome!

# Experiments folder README

This directory contains various functions that use the main biosnicar model code in some non-standard way.

These are stored here to keep /src clean and dedicated only to core model code.

At the moment utils.py is acting as a bit of a miscellaneous repository for useful functions calling biosnicar. These are all configured usign config.yaml and executed by running `driver.py`.

TODO: Expand this README, tidy up utils.py
